                                <span>Of holy anthems once was heard</span>
                                <span>From many a saint, the hills prolong</span>

                                <span>Delicious prospects meet the eye,</span>
                                <span>The ear is charmed with Phil'mel's song.</span>

                                <span>Resigned her note in earthly choirs</span>
                                <span>Which now in Heaven must sound alway.</span>

                                <span>Their fiercest cries to music mild.</span>

                                <span>The subject tribes inspired with awe.</span>

                                <span>Of Phil'mel sounds and checks alarms.</span>
                                <span>But when shall I once more renew</span>
                                <span>Those heavenly hours in Gladys' arms?"</span>

                        <p>"Taliesin" was the pseudonym of an amiable clergyman, the Reverend Owen Thomas, for many years curate of Llantrisant. He died in 1820, at the great age of eighty-four. His original poetry in Welsh was reputed as far superior to his translations, and he made a very valuable and curious collection of "Cymric Antiquities," which remains in manuscript in the keeping of his descendants. <a href="chapter-3-4.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
